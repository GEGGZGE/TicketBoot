## What does this Do?
Basically, what TicketBoot does is he Handles tickets for your server. So let's say someone needs to talk to a staff, they can run `-ticket <Description>` then it will make a Channel for only you and staff to see. This can help users and Guilds alot!  

TicketBoot are used by me and my team, so it can help them Handle things easier.
